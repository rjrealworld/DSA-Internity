## What is Data?

Data refers to distinct pieces of information, usually formatted and stored in a way that is concordant with a specific purpose. Data can exist in various forms: as numbers or text recorded on paper, as bits or bytes stored in electronic memory, or as facts living in a personâ€™s mind.

## What is Data Structures?

A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.

## What is abstract data types?

An abstract data type is a model for data consisting of values and operations, whose concrete structure is hidden. 
For example, a Set abstract data type is defined as having operations like add and remove. Each of these operations mutates or returns a value, but the means by which they do so, or by which a Set is represented, is hidden from consumers of the Set type. 
So, ADT only mentions what operations are to be performed but not how these operations will be implemented.

## Need of DS in real life

I've noticed many people assuming algorithms are pointless questions that are asked by tech companies purely as an arbitrary measure. I hear more people complain about how all of this is a purely academic exercise. 
I have come across everyday use cases of data structures and algorithms while learning in WTEF.
This included writing code and making decisions based on these concepts. But for the most part, I used this knowledge to understand how and why some things were built. Knowing these concepts made it easy to understand design and implementations referencing these.
For example - 
1. Everyone uses Google Maps to check out routes and traffics. That applicaiton is actually implemented on the basis of Graphs and weighted trees concepts.
2. To store the possible moves in a chess game.
3. To store the customer order information in a drive-in burger place. 
And there are infinite use case for Data Structures.
